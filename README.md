# How is this different to strings?
elf-strings reads the binary's dedicated string sections in order to extract meaningful data. This can be extremely useful when analysing a binary as it removes all the junk from parts of the ELF that would not traditionaly contain strings, but still might render garbage in for example `strings`.

# Features
